Error: the constructor of the type `RefBox a&` has an invalid type `a& -> RefBox a&`. The constructor must be an impure function returning an instance of `RefBox a&`.
During evaluation of:
  ref RefBox a = {
      data = {
          a :: a ;
      }

      ctor :: a -> RefBox a ;
      ctor a = {
          this.data . a := a ;
          return () ;
      } ;

      get :: impure -> a ;
      get = this.data . a ;

      set :: a -> impure -> () ;
      set a = {
