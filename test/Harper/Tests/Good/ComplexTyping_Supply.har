// This is a port of a Haskell source I once wrote as an assignment for a Haskell course.
// Find the Haskell source at the bottom.
// It's supposed to provide types of infinite streams of values and operations that consume such streams.
// Here it's used to traverse a tree and number its leaves in infix order.
// This is a good benchmark of Harper's type system (its pure part at least).
